# DebtCollector

## Description
The main idea is to store all the debts between users, change it (add, subtract), and do it in a pretty web-service.

## Why?
1. We had problems in dormitory plenty of time(s) since no one remember how much who pays who two weeks later.
2. The reason for Py3 + Flask is that I needed to make a test task for one of the vacancy.

## Usage
1. Install the dependencies (reqs.txt)
2. For the test reasons, just execute run.py with python3.
